(* Server session state shared among the Server subcontexts (Shared / Local / Cloud).
   These are read by the transport-agnostic handlers in Shared.wl and bound (via Block)
   by each transport. They are not read elsewhere in the paclet, so they live here rather
   than in CommonSymbols.wl. `handleMethod` and `initializeServerState` are declared in
   CommonSymbols.wl instead, since they are needed paclet-wide. *)

(*Current MCP Server Information*)

(* Exported descriptors of where the current MCP server is running, for tools that adapt their behavior
   to the host. Both are None outside a server session; each transport Blocks them for the duration of a
   session (local) or request (cloud) before the server state is built:

     $MCPEvaluationEnvironment  "Local" for the stdio server started by StartMCPServer, or "Cloud" for a
                                cloud-deployed server handled by RunCloudMCPServer.
     $MCPTransport              "StandardInputOutput" for the stdio transport, or "StreamableHTTP" for
                                the cloud (Streamable HTTP) transport.

   Tools consult these through the "Overrides" key of their LLMTool data (see applyToolOverrides in
   Shared.wl): a delayed association of tool properties merged in when the server state is built, e.g.
   WriteNotebook swaps in a cloud-object writer when $MCPEvaluationEnvironment === "Cloud". *)
$MCPEvaluationEnvironment = None;
$MCPTransport             = None;

(* Exported descriptors of the standalone MCP server product: a kernel that only runs the MCP server, without a full
   Mathematica installation and under its own licensing. Nothing in this paclet sets them; the standalone application
   sets both after the paclet has been loaded (loading resets them to the defaults below). Like the other exported
   symbols they are Protected (see $AgentToolsProtectedNames in Main.wl), so setting them takes Unprotect or Block.

     $StandaloneMCPServer             True when running under the standalone MCP server, False everywhere else.
     $StandaloneMCPServerInformation  Information the standalone product publishes about itself (version, build,
                                      and so on), as an association with string keys; empty everywhere else.

   Both are included in the usage data of local server sessions (usageDataPayload in UsageData.wl); the information
   association is included as it is, with values that JSON cannot represent written as strings (jsonConvert in
   Files.wl), so it must only describe the product, never anything about a session. *)
$StandaloneMCPServer            = False;
