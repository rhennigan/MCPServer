# MCP Apps in AgentTools

This document explains how MCP Apps work in AgentTools and how to extend them.

## Overview

[MCP Apps](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/extensions/apps) is the first official MCP extension (`io.modelcontextprotocol/ui`), enabling servers to deliver interactive HTML user interfaces that render inside MCP hosts (Claude Desktop, VS Code, etc.) in sandboxed iframes.

AgentTools uses MCP Apps to provide:

- **Interactive Wolfram|Alpha results** displayed in an embedded notebook viewer
- **Rich evaluation output** from `WolframLanguageEvaluator` with interactive cloud notebooks
- **Embedded notebook viewers** for Wolfram Cloud notebooks

When a client does not support MCP Apps, all tools fall back to their standard text and image output, maintaining full backward compatibility.

## How It Works

### Capability Negotiation

MCP Apps support is negotiated during the `initialize` handshake:

1. The client advertises support for the `io.modelcontextprotocol/ui` extension in its `capabilities`
2. The server detects this and echoes the extension in its response
3. For the rest of the session, the server enriches tool definitions and results with UI metadata

The server checks two conditions before enabling MCP Apps:

- The client must advertise `io.modelcontextprotocol/ui` in `capabilities.extensions`
- The `MCP_APPS_ENABLED` environment variable must not be set to `"false"`

> **Cloud deployments.** MCP Apps are also supported by [cloud-deployed servers](cloud-deployment.md), whose stateless HTTP transport has no session store to hold `$clientSupportsUI` between requests. There, the negotiated capability is carried in a self-describing `Mcp-Session-Id` header that the client echoes on each request, re-establishing the same flag per request. If a client does not echo the session ID, MCP Apps simply stays off (fail-safe).

### UI Resources

UI resources are HTML apps served via the MCP `resources/read` endpoint. Each resource is identified by a `ui://` URI (e.g., `ui://wolfram/wolframalpha-viewer`).

Resources are loaded from HTML files in the `Assets/Apps/` directory at server startup. Each HTML file can have an accompanying `.json` metadata file with the same base name.

The server handles these MCP methods for UI resources:

| Method | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `resources/list` | Returns the list of available UI resources (empty if MCP Apps is not active) |
| `resources/read` | Returns the HTML content and metadata for a specific UI resource |

### Tool-UI Linkage

Tools can be associated with a UI resource. When the client supports MCP Apps, the `tools/list` response includes `_meta.ui` metadata on each linked tool:

```json
{
  "name": "WolframAlpha",
  "description": "...",
  "inputSchema": { ... },
  "_meta": {
    "ui": {
      "resourceUri": "ui://wolfram/wolframalpha-viewer",
      "visibility": ["model", "app"]
    }
  }
}
```

The host uses this metadata to preload the HTML app and render it alongside tool results.

### UI-Enhanced Tool Results

When MCP Apps is active, certain tools return enhanced results with `_meta` containing a `notebookUrl`. The host forwards this metadata to the rendered app, which can then embed the notebook interactively.

Tools with UI-enhanced behavior:

| Tool | Enhancement |
|------|-------------|
| `WolframAlpha` | Deploys a cloud notebook with formatted Wolfram\|Alpha pods and returns `notebookUrl` in `_meta` |
| `WolframLanguageEvaluator` | Deploys a cloud notebook with evaluation results and returns `notebookUrl` in `_meta` |

These enhancements require both MCP Apps support and an active Wolfram Cloud connection. The session flag `$deployCloudNotebooks` (initialized from `$CloudConnected`) gates deployment: if a `CloudDeploy` call fails at runtime, the helper `deployCloudNotebookForMCPApp` sets the flag to `False` and the tools fall back to their standard (non-UI) results for the rest of the session rather than surfacing an internal failure.

Cloud notebooks are deployed with `AppearanceElements -> None` by default, which hides the footer links that would not be clickable inside the MCP App iframe. Some cloud accounts reject this option with `CloudDeploy::appearancenotsup`; in that case the deployment is transparently retried without `AppearanceElements`, and the unsupported status is cached in a session flag (`$includeAppearanceElements`) so subsequent deployments skip the failing attempt.

The fallback is per-tool:

- `WolframLanguageEvaluator` always has a text/image result it can return, so it degrades in place.
- `WolframAlpha` has no text-only fallback app view, so its entry in `$toolUIAssociations` is itself conditional on `$deployCloudNotebooks` — when the flag is `False`, no `_meta.ui` is attached to the tool definition and the client never sees it as a UI-enabled tool.

### Notebook Delivery: Cloud vs. Inline

By default, a UI-enhanced notebook is deployed to the Wolfram Cloud and its URL is sent to the app in `_meta.notebookUrl`. An experimental alternative serializes the notebook and embeds it inline, avoiding the cloud round-trip. The delivery method is selected by the `MCP_APPS_NOTEBOOK_METHOD` environment variable:

| `MCP_APPS_NOTEBOOK_METHOD` | Behavior of `deployCloudNotebookForMCPApp` |
|----------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| unset (default) | Deploys the notebook with `CloudDeploy` and returns the cloud URL |
| `"Inline"` | Returns `ExportString[nb, "NB"]` — the serialized notebook itself — instead of a URL |

The same `notebookUrl` field carries both forms. Each viewer app (`evaluator-viewer.html`, `notebook-viewer.html`, `wolframalpha-viewer.html`) decides how to embed based on the value: a string starting with `http` is embedded as a cloud URL, while any other value is passed to `WolframNotebookEmbedder.embed` as an inline notebook expression (`{expr: ...}`).

Inline embedding is **experimental and not yet the default**. Both methods currently require an active cloud connection, since the UI-enhanced path is gated on `$deployCloudNotebooks` regardless of the delivery method (the `"Inline"` branch only asserts the flag rather than deploying).

When inline embedding is active, graphics can render empty in the embedded notebook. The `delayedDisplay` helper works around this for `WolframLanguageEvaluator` output: any output boxes containing `GraphicsBox`/`Graphics3DBox` are serialized and reconstructed asynchronously inside a `DynamicModule` (showing a progress indicator until ready). Outside inline mode, or for output without graphics, `delayedDisplay` returns the boxes unchanged.

### Rendering the Notebook: Embedder vs. Cross-Origin Iframe

`WolframNotebookEmbedder.embed` does **not** use an iframe. It fetches `wolframcloud.com/notebooks/embedding` and injects the cloud notebook engine's scripts (`mainScript` + `otherScripts`) directly into the **app document**, where the engine then runs. That engine uses `eval`/`new Function` and WebAssembly, all of which the browser gates on the app iframe's CSP `script-src 'unsafe-eval'` (WASM additionally on `'wasm-unsafe-eval'`).

Strict MCP hosts build the app sandbox CSP **without** `'unsafe-eval'`, and there is no way for the server to add it. Goose, for example, constructs the CSP server-side (`crates/goose/src/acp/mcp_app_proxy.rs`) and runs every declared `csp` domain through a validator (`normalize_csp_source`) that rejects any entry containing a `'` (single quote) — so quoted keyword-sources like `'unsafe-eval'`/`'wasm-unsafe-eval'` are dropped, exactly as `data:` in `connectDomains` is dropped. Under such a CSP the injected engine throws `EvalError` and the notebook never renders, even though the embedder's `embed()` promise resolves.

To render the notebook anyway, each embedding viewer (`evaluator-viewer`, `notebook-viewer`, `wolframalpha-viewer`) probes eval capability once at startup with `cspAllowsEval` (a synchronous `new Function("")`, which throws under a no-`'unsafe-eval'` policy):

- **eval permitted** → use `WolframNotebookEmbedder` as before (in-document render, fit-to-content sizing).
- **eval blocked** → `embedNotebookViaIframe` points a plain cross-origin `<iframe>` straight at the cloud notebook URL. The notebook then renders inside `wolframcloud.com`'s own origin under *its* CSP (which permits `unsafe-eval`), fully isolated from the app's CSP. The app's `frame-src` already allows `https://www.wolframcloud.com`, and the notebook is deployed chrome-free (`AppearanceElements -> None`), so the framed page shows just the notebook.

The fallback is additive — nothing changes on eval-permitting hosts. Two constraints are worth noting:

- **Sizing.** A cross-origin iframe can't be measured by the app, so it opens at a default height (`NOTEBOOK_IFRAME_HEIGHT`, 200 px; `notebook-viewer` uses a finite positive `maxHeight` tool argument when given) that the user can grow with a drag handle along the frame's bottom edge (`makeResizableFrame`), with internal scrolling, rather than the embedder's fit-to-content sizing. A native corner `resize` grip is avoided because the framed notebook's own scrollbar sits on top of it and swallows the clicks.
- **Cloud URLs only.** Only an `http(s)` cloud URL can be framed. Inline notebooks (`MCP_APPS_NOTEBOOK_METHOD="Inline"`) carry a serialized expression with no URL, so on an eval-blocked host they fall through to the text/image result — another reason inline delivery remains experimental.

### Recovering the Notebook URL When `_meta` Is Dropped

The `notebookUrl` is delivered to the app through `_meta`, which is meant to reach the app without entering model context. (The MCP Apps spec also defines `structuredContent` for this, but the server deliberately does **not** send it: some clients discard a tool result's `content` — text and images — entirely when `structuredContent` is present, which we do not want.) Some hosts, however, drop `_meta` from tool results ([ext-apps#696](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/ext-apps/issues/696)), so the app never receives the URL directly and can only render the text/image fallback. Those same hosts also do not forward app-initiated `resources/read` (they answer it with JSON-RPC `-32601 "Method not found"`), so the app cannot ask the server for the URL either.

The one channel that does survive is the tool result's `content`. So for cloud-notebook results, `makeNotebookUIResult` wraps the content in a `<result uuid="…">…</result>` marker whose `uuid` identifies the deployed cloud notebook (a text item before and after the result text):

```
<result uuid="e0f29bea-667b-4780-b36b-59de225e660e">
Out[1]= 2543568463
</result>
```

Notebooks are deployed with `CloudObjectNameFormat -> "UUID"`, so the deployed URL is already `https://www.wolframcloud.com/obj/<uuid>` and the `uuid` is recovered from it with no extra round-trip (`cloudNotebookUUID`). When a viewer sees a result with no `notebookUrl` in `_meta`, it falls back to `extractNotebookUrlMarker`, which reads the `uuid` from the marker and reconstructs the same cloud URL as `https://www.wolframcloud.com/obj/<uuid>`. Both delivery paths carry a `syntaxMethod=editor` query parameter on the embedded-notebook URL: the server appends it to `notebookUrl` (`notebookEmbedURL`), and the viewers append the same parameter when reconstructing from the marker — the two must stay in sync. Each text-rendering viewer also strips the surrounding `<result>` tags (via `stripAgentOnlyText`), keeping the wrapped result text, so the tags never reach the user.

This path applies only to cloud delivery: inline notebooks (`MCP_APPS_NOTEBOOK_METHOD="Inline"`) carry the whole serialized notebook, which is delivered via `_meta` only, so no wrapper is added. The `notebook-viewer` app normally receives its URL through the tool **input** (`arguments.url`), which is unaffected by the dropped-`_meta` issue; it applies the same marker recovery only as a fallback when a result arrives without a prior embed.

### Custom Cloud Base

All cloud URLs above assume the production cloud, `https://www.wolframcloud.com`. Setting the `WOLFRAM_CLOUDBASE` environment variable (primarily for internal purposes) points the server at a different cloud:

```json
"env": { "WOLFRAM_CLOUDBASE": "https://www.test.wolframcloud.com" }
```

At server startup, `setCloudBaseFromEnvironment` assigns the value to `$CloudBase`, so notebook deployments (and every other cloud operation) target that cloud. The static app assets are adjusted to match as they are loaded from disk (`loadUIResource`):

- Each viewer declares the cloud base in a `var WOLFRAM_CLOUDBASE = "https://www.wolframcloud.com";` assignment, which it uses to reconstruct notebook URLs from `<result uuid="…">` markers and to accept the configured origin in the iframe-fallback URL check (`isWolframCloudUrl`). The sandboxed JavaScript cannot read environment variables, so `applyCloudBaseToHTML` rewrites this assignment via string replacement when the HTML is read.
- The JSON metadata's CSP domain lists (`connectDomains`, `resourceDomains`, `frameDomains`) must also allow the custom cloud, so `applyCloudBaseToMeta` prepends the custom base to every list that allows the default base. The default entries are kept so production URLs remain reachable (e.g. `wolfr.am` frames can redirect to production).

## Available UI Resources

| URI | HTML Asset | Description |
|-----|-----------|-------------|
| `ui://wolfram/wolframalpha-viewer` | `wolframalpha-viewer.html` | Displays Wolfram\|Alpha results with embedded notebook viewer |
| `ui://wolfram/evaluator-viewer` | `evaluator-viewer.html` | Displays Wolfram Language evaluation results with embedded notebook viewer |
| `ui://wolfram/notebook-viewer` | `notebook-viewer.html` | Generic embedded Wolfram Cloud notebook viewer |
| `ui://wolfram/mcp-apps-test` | `mcp-apps-test.html` | Diagnostic app for testing the MCP Apps pipeline |

## Available MCP Apps Tools

These tools are defined in `$DefaultMCPTools` but are not included in any default server configuration:

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `NotebookViewer` | Embeds an interactive Wolfram Cloud notebook given a URL |
| `MCPAppsTest` | Diagnostic tool that echoes input with server metadata, useful for testing the MCP Apps pipeline |

To include these tools in a custom server:

```wl
CreateMCPServer["MyServer", <|
    "Tools" -> {
        "WolframLanguageEvaluator",
        "WolframAlpha",
        "NotebookViewer"
    }
|>]
```

## Tool-UI Associations

The mapping between tools and their UI resources is defined in `$toolUIAssociations` in `Kernel/UIResources.wl`:

| Tool | UI Resource URI |
|------|----------------|
| `NotebookViewer` | `ui://wolfram/notebook-viewer` |
| `MCPAppsTest` | `ui://wolfram/mcp-apps-test` |
| `WolframAlpha` | `ui://wolfram/wolframalpha-viewer` (only when `$deployCloudNotebooks` is `True`) |
| `WolframLanguageEvaluator` | `ui://wolfram/evaluator-viewer` |

## Disabling MCP Apps

MCP Apps can be disabled at install time:

```wl
InstallMCPServer["ClaudeDesktop", "EnableMCPApps" -> False]
```

This sets `MCP_APPS_ENABLED=false` in the server's environment, which prevents the server from negotiating UI support regardless of client capabilities.

MCP Apps are also effectively disabled when:

- The client does not advertise the `io.modelcontextprotocol/ui` extension
- The server cannot load its UI assets (graceful fallback)

## Adding a New UI Resource

### Step 1: Create the HTML App

Create an HTML file in `Assets/Apps/`:

```
Assets/Apps/my-app.html
```

The HTML file should implement the MCP Apps host-app protocol using `postMessage`. At minimum, the app should:

1. Send `ui/initialize` to the host when ready
2. Handle `ui/notifications/tool-input` and `ui/notifications/tool-result` messages

### Step 2: Add Optional Metadata

Create a JSON metadata file with the same base name:

```
Assets/Apps/my-app.json
```

This file can contain CSP declarations and other metadata used by the host. Under `csp`, the host adds an implicit `'self'` and appends each declared domain to the matching directive:

| `csp` field | Maps to | Governs |
|-------------|---------|---------|
| `connectDomains` | `connect-src` | `fetch`/XHR/WebSocket, and `data:`/streaming WebAssembly loads |
| `resourceDomains` | `script-src`, `style-src`, `img-src`, … | External scripts, styles, images, fonts |
| `frameDomains` | `frame-src` | Nested iframes (e.g. the embedded notebook) |

Apps that embed a notebook with `WolframNotebookEmbedder` must include `"data:"` in `connectDomains`: the embedder's WXFWeb library instantiates a WebAssembly module from a `data:` URI, which the browser governs under `connect-src`. The `evaluator-viewer`, `notebook-viewer`, and `wolframalpha-viewer` apps declare this.

CSP only governs whether a request may *start*; cross-origin *responses* are still subject to CORS, which the host cannot influence through this metadata.

### Step 3: Associate with a Tool

Add the tool-to-resource mapping in `$toolUIAssociations` in `Kernel/UIResources.wl`:

```wl
$toolUIAssociations = <|
    (* ... existing entries ... *)
    "MyTool" -> "ui://wolfram/my-app"
|>;
```

The URI is derived from the HTML filename: `ui://wolfram/<basename>`.

### Step 4: Write Tests

Add tests in `Tests/` for the new resource. See the existing test files (`Tests/MCPApps.wlt`, `Tests/MCPAppsTest.wlt`, etc.) for patterns.
