# MCP Apps in AgentTools

This document explains how MCP Apps work in AgentTools and how to extend them.

## Overview

[MCP Apps](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/extensions/apps) is the first official MCP extension (`io.modelcontextprotocol/ui`), enabling servers to deliver interactive HTML user interfaces that render inside MCP hosts (Claude Desktop, VS Code, etc.) in sandboxed iframes.

AgentTools uses MCP Apps to provide:

- **Interactive Wolfram|Alpha results** displayed in an embedded notebook viewer
- **Rich evaluation output** from `WolframLanguageEvaluator` with interactive cloud notebooks
- **Embedded notebook viewers** for Wolfram Cloud notebooks

When a client does not support MCP Apps, all tools fall back to their standard text and image output, maintaining full backward compatibility.

## How It Works

### Capability Negotiation

MCP Apps support is negotiated during the `initialize` handshake:

1. The client advertises support for the `io.modelcontextprotocol/ui` extension in its `capabilities`
2. The server detects this and echoes the extension in its response
3. For the rest of the session, the server enriches tool definitions and results with UI metadata

The server checks two conditions before enabling MCP Apps:

- The client must advertise `io.modelcontextprotocol/ui` in `capabilities.extensions`
- The `MCP_APPS_ENABLED` environment variable must not be set to `"false"`

### UI Resources

UI resources are HTML apps served via the MCP `resources/read` endpoint. Each resource is identified by a `ui://` URI (e.g., `ui://wolfram/wolframalpha-viewer`).

Resources are loaded from HTML files in the `Assets/Apps/` directory at server startup. Each HTML file can have an accompanying `.json` metadata file with the same base name.

The server handles these MCP methods for UI resources:

| Method | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `resources/list` | Returns the list of available UI resources (empty if MCP Apps is not active) |
| `resources/read` | Returns the HTML content and metadata for a specific UI resource |

### Tool-UI Linkage

Tools can be associated with a UI resource. When the client supports MCP Apps, the `tools/list` response includes `_meta.ui` metadata on each linked tool:

```json
{
  "name": "WolframAlpha",
  "description": "...",
  "inputSchema": { ... },
  "_meta": {
    "ui": {
      "resourceUri": "ui://wolfram/wolframalpha-viewer",
      "visibility": ["model", "app"]
    }
  }
}
```

The host uses this metadata to preload the HTML app and render it alongside tool results.

### UI-Enhanced Tool Results

When MCP Apps is active, certain tools return enhanced results with `_meta` containing a `notebookUrl`. The host forwards this metadata to the rendered app, which can then embed the notebook interactively.

Tools with UI-enhanced behavior:

| Tool | Enhancement |
|------|-------------|
| `WolframAlpha` | Deploys a cloud notebook with formatted Wolfram\|Alpha pods and returns `notebookUrl` in `_meta` |
| `WolframLanguageEvaluator` | Deploys a cloud notebook with evaluation results and returns `notebookUrl` in `_meta` |

These enhancements require both MCP Apps support and an active Wolfram Cloud connection. The session flag `$deployCloudNotebooks` (initialized from `$CloudConnected`) gates deployment: if a `CloudDeploy` call fails at runtime, the helper `deployCloudNotebookForMCPApp` sets the flag to `False` and the tools fall back to their standard (non-UI) results for the rest of the session rather than surfacing an internal failure.

Cloud notebooks are deployed with `AppearanceElements -> None` by default, which hides the footer links that would not be clickable inside the MCP App iframe. Some cloud accounts reject this option with `CloudDeploy::appearancenotsup`; in that case the deployment is transparently retried without `AppearanceElements`, and the unsupported status is cached in a session flag (`$includeAppearanceElements`) so subsequent deployments skip the failing attempt.

The fallback is per-tool:

- `WolframLanguageEvaluator` always has a text/image result it can return, so it degrades in place.
- `WolframAlpha` has no text-only fallback app view, so its entry in `$toolUIAssociations` is itself conditional on `$deployCloudNotebooks` — when the flag is `False`, no `_meta.ui` is attached to the tool definition and the client never sees it as a UI-enabled tool.

## Available UI Resources

| URI | HTML Asset | Description |
|-----|-----------|-------------|
| `ui://wolfram/wolframalpha-viewer` | `wolframalpha-viewer.html` | Displays Wolfram\|Alpha results with embedded notebook viewer |
| `ui://wolfram/evaluator-viewer` | `evaluator-viewer.html` | Displays Wolfram Language evaluation results with embedded notebook viewer |
| `ui://wolfram/notebook-viewer` | `notebook-viewer.html` | Generic embedded Wolfram Cloud notebook viewer |
| `ui://wolfram/mcp-apps-test` | `mcp-apps-test.html` | Diagnostic app for testing the MCP Apps pipeline |

## Available MCP Apps Tools

These tools are defined in `$DefaultMCPTools` but are not included in any default server configuration:

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `NotebookViewer` | Embeds an interactive Wolfram Cloud notebook given a URL |
| `MCPAppsTest` | Diagnostic tool that echoes input with server metadata, useful for testing the MCP Apps pipeline |

To include these tools in a custom server:

```wl
CreateMCPServer["MyServer", <|
    "Tools" -> {
        "WolframLanguageEvaluator",
        "WolframAlpha",
        "NotebookViewer"
    }
|>]
```

## Tool-UI Associations

The mapping between tools and their UI resources is defined in `$toolUIAssociations` in `Kernel/UIResources.wl`:

| Tool | UI Resource URI |
|------|----------------|
| `NotebookViewer` | `ui://wolfram/notebook-viewer` |
| `MCPAppsTest` | `ui://wolfram/mcp-apps-test` |
| `WolframAlpha` | `ui://wolfram/wolframalpha-viewer` (only when `$deployCloudNotebooks` is `True`) |
| `WolframLanguageEvaluator` | `ui://wolfram/evaluator-viewer` |

## Disabling MCP Apps

MCP Apps can be disabled at install time:

```wl
InstallMCPServer["ClaudeDesktop", "EnableMCPApps" -> False]
```

This sets `MCP_APPS_ENABLED=false` in the server's environment, which prevents the server from negotiating UI support regardless of client capabilities.

MCP Apps are also effectively disabled when:

- The client does not advertise the `io.modelcontextprotocol/ui` extension
- The server cannot load its UI assets (graceful fallback)

## Adding a New UI Resource

### Step 1: Create the HTML App

Create an HTML file in `Assets/Apps/`:

```
Assets/Apps/my-app.html
```

The HTML file should implement the MCP Apps host-app protocol using `postMessage`. At minimum, the app should:

1. Send `ui/initialize` to the host when ready
2. Handle `ui/notifications/tool-input` and `ui/notifications/tool-result` messages

### Step 2: Add Optional Metadata

Create a JSON metadata file with the same base name:

```
Assets/Apps/my-app.json
```

This file can contain CSP declarations and other metadata used by the host.

### Step 3: Associate with a Tool

Add the tool-to-resource mapping in `$toolUIAssociations` in `Kernel/UIResources.wl`:

```wl
$toolUIAssociations = <|
    (* ... existing entries ... *)
    "MyTool" -> "ui://wolfram/my-app"
|>;
```

The URI is derived from the HTML filename: `ui://wolfram/<basename>`.

### Step 4: Write Tests

Add tests in `Tests/` for the new resource. See the existing test files (`Tests/MCPApps.wlt`, `Tests/MCPAppsTest.wlt`, etc.) for patterns.
