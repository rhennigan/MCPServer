# MCP Apps - Design Specification

## Overview

This specification defines the design for integrating [MCP Apps](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/extensions/apps) into the AgentTools paclet. MCP Apps is the first official MCP extension (`io.modelcontextprotocol/ui`), enabling servers to deliver interactive HTML user interfaces that render inside MCP hosts (Claude Desktop, VS Code, etc.) in sandboxed iframes.

This enables three key use cases for the Wolfram MCP server:

1. **Interactive WolframAlpha results** -- full WA experience embedded in an iframe
2. **CloudDeploy results in iframes** -- live Wolfram Cloud deployments embedded in conversation
3. **Rich WL evaluator output** -- interactive graphics, formatted expressions, Manipulate-like controls

## Goals

- Implement MCP Apps extension negotiation so UI-capable clients get interactive experiences
- Serve HTML apps via `resources/read` for `ui://` resources
- Add `_meta.ui` metadata to tools that support interactive display
- Maintain full backward compatibility for clients that do not support MCP Apps
- Store HTML app templates as paclet assets, loaded at runtime
- Support graceful degradation: non-UI clients continue to receive text + base64 PNG as today

---

## Background: MCP Apps Protocol

### Extension Identity

- **Extension ID:** `io.modelcontextprotocol/ui`
- **Spec version:** `2026-01-26`
- **MIME type:** `text/html;profile=mcp-app`
- **Resource URI scheme:** `ui://`

### Capability Negotiation

MCP Apps support is negotiated during `initialize`. The client advertises the extension in `capabilities.extensions`:

```json
{
  "method": "initialize",
  "params": {
    "protocolVersion": "2024-11-05",
    "capabilities": {
      "extensions": {
        "io.modelcontextprotocol/ui": {
          "mimeTypes": ["text/html;profile=mcp-app"]
        }
      }
    },
    "clientInfo": { "name": "claude-desktop", "version": "1.0.0" }
  }
}
```

The server echoes the extension in its response if it supports it:

```json
{
  "result": {
    "protocolVersion": "2024-11-05",
    "capabilities": {
      "tools": { "listChanged": true },
      "prompts": {},
      "extensions": {
        "io.modelcontextprotocol/ui": {
          "mimeTypes": ["text/html;profile=mcp-app"]
        }
      }
    },
    "serverInfo": { "name": "WolframLanguage", "version": "1.5.0" }
  }
}
```

### Tool-UI Linkage

Tools declare an associated UI resource via `_meta.ui`:

```json
{
  "name": "WolframAlpha",
  "description": "...",
  "inputSchema": { ... },
  "_meta": {
    "ui": {
      "resourceUri": "ui://wolfram/wolframalpha-viewer",
      "visibility": ["model", "app"]
    }
  }
}
```

### Resource Serving

The host fetches UI resources via `resources/read`:

```json
{
  "method": "resources/read",
  "params": { "uri": "ui://wolfram/wolframalpha-viewer" }
}
```

Response:

```json
{
  "result": {
    "contents": [{
      "uri": "ui://wolfram/wolframalpha-viewer",
      "mimeType": "text/html;profile=mcp-app",
      "text": "<!DOCTYPE html><html>...</html>",
      "_meta": {
        "ui": {
          "csp": {
            "connectDomains": [],
            "resourceDomains": [],
            "frameDomains": []
          },
          "prefersBorder": true
        }
      }
    }]
  }
}
```

### Responsibility Model

MCP Apps involve three parties with distinct responsibilities:

| Party | Responsibilities |
|-------|-----------------|
| **MCP Server** (our code) | Extension negotiation, serving UI resources via `resources/read`, attaching `_meta.ui` to tools, executing tool calls |
| **MCP Host** (Claude Desktop, VS Code, etc.) | Rendering iframes, enforcing CSP/sandbox, proxying `postMessage` between app and server, filtering tool visibility for LLM |
| **MCP App** (HTML in iframe) | Implementing `ui/initialize`, handling `ui/notifications/*`, rendering interactive UI, calling `tools/call` via host |

The `ui/*` messages (e.g., `ui/initialize`, `ui/notifications/tool-input`) are part of the **host-app protocol** over `postMessage`. The server does NOT handle these messages directly. The server only handles standard MCP messages (`initialize`, `resources/list`, `resources/read`, `tools/list`, `tools/call`).

### App Lifecycle

1. **Preload**: Host reads `_meta.ui.resourceUri` from tool definition, fetches HTML via `resources/read` (server handles this)
2. **Render**: Host renders HTML in a sandboxed iframe (host responsibility)
3. **Initialize**: App sends `ui/initialize` to host via `postMessage` (host-app protocol)
4. **Tool Input**: Host forwards tool arguments via `ui/notifications/tool-input` (host-app protocol)
5. **Tool Result**: Host forwards tool result via `ui/notifications/tool-result` (host-app protocol)
6. **Interactive**: App can call `tools/call` back through host, which forwards to server (server handles the `tools/call`)
7. **Teardown**: Host sends `ui/resource-teardown`, iframe is removed (host-app protocol)

### Tool Visibility

- `["model", "app"]` (default): Tool visible to LLM and callable by app
- `["model"]`: Tool visible to LLM only; app cannot call it
- `["app"]`: Hidden from LLM; only callable by app (useful for pagination, re-evaluation)

### Security Model

- Apps run in sandboxed iframes with `allow-scripts allow-same-origin`
- CSP is constructed from declared `csp` domains; default is highly restrictive
- All communication via `postMessage` JSON-RPC 2.0
- Hosts control which tools apps can call

---

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Infrastructure

Core protocol changes to support MCP Apps negotiation, resource serving, and tool metadata.

#### 1.1 Extension Negotiation

During `initialize`, the server inspects the client's `capabilities.extensions` for `io.modelcontextprotocol/ui` and stores the result in a shared flag (`$clientSupportsUI`) so downstream code can branch on it.

Key requirements:

- The `initialize` response must be computed dynamically (not pre-computed at startup) so it can reflect whether the connecting client supports UI.
- `$clientSupportsUI` must be set *before* computing the init response, since the response builder reads it to decide whether to include `capabilities.extensions`.
- When the client advertises UI support, the server echoes `io.modelcontextprotocol/ui` back in `capabilities.extensions`. When it does not, the `extensions` field is omitted entirely.

#### 1.2 UI Resource Registry

An in-memory registry mapping `ui://` URIs to HTML content and metadata, populated at server startup from paclet assets.

Each registry entry contains:

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `uri` | The `ui://wolfram/<name>` URI |
| `name` | Human-readable name for the resource |
| `mimeType` | Always `text/html;profile=mcp-app` |
| `html` | The full HTML content (loaded from `Assets/Apps/<name>.html`) |
| `meta` | CSP and display metadata (loaded from `Assets/Apps/<name>.json`, if present) |

Loading behavior:

- At startup, scan the `Assets/Apps/` paclet asset directory for `*.html` files.
- For each HTML file, derive the URI from the file's base name: `ui://wolfram/<baseName>`.
- If a corresponding `<baseName>.json` file exists alongside the HTML file, load it as metadata.
- HTML files are read from disk once and cached in memory. Restarting the server reloads them.
- If the assets directory is missing or loading fails, log an error and initialize the registry as empty. Do not fail server startup.

#### 1.3 Resources Handler

Handle `resources/list` and `resources/read` MCP methods:

- **`resources/list`**: When the client supports UI, return the registered UI resources (URI, name, description, mimeType). Otherwise return an empty list.
- **`resources/read`**: Look up the requested URI in the registry. If found, return the HTML content, mimeType, and `_meta` from the registry entry. If not found, return a standard MCP error (`-32602`).

#### 1.4 Tool Metadata

When building the tool list for `tools/list`, conditionally attach `_meta.ui` to tools that have a registered UI resource:

- Maintain a mapping from tool names to UI resource URIs (e.g., `"WolframAlpha"` -> `"ui://wolfram/wolframalpha-viewer"`).
- When `$clientSupportsUI` is true, include a `_meta` field on matching tools containing `ui.resourceUri` and `ui.visibility`.
- When `$clientSupportsUI` is false, omit `_meta` entirely.

Tool-to-UI associations:

| Tool Name | UI Resource URI |
|-----------|----------------|
| `WolframAlpha` | `ui://wolfram/wolframalpha-viewer` |
| `WolframLanguageEvaluator` | `ui://wolfram/evaluator-viewer` |

#### 1.5 Graceful Degradation

The design ensures backward compatibility:

| Aspect | UI-capable client | Non-UI client |
|--------|-------------------|---------------|
| `initialize` response | Includes `capabilities.extensions` | No `extensions` field |
| `resources/list` | Returns UI resources | Returns empty `{ "resources": [] }` |
| `resources/read` | Returns HTML content | Returns error (no resources registered) |
| `tools/list` tool count | All tools including app-only | Standard tools only (app-only tools excluded) |
| `tools/list` metadata | Includes `_meta.ui` on UI-linked tools | No `_meta` field on any tools |
| `tools/call` WolframAlpha results | JSON metadata (notebookUrl) + text + base64 PNG | Text + base64 PNG (unchanged) |
| `tools/call` other tool results | Unchanged (text + base64 PNG) | Unchanged (text + base64 PNG) |

Detailed rules:

- **Extension negotiation is opt-in.** If the client does not advertise `io.modelcontextprotocol/ui` in its `capabilities.extensions` (or does not send `capabilities` at all), the server responds exactly as it does today.
- **App-only tools are excluded for non-UI clients.** Tools with visibility `["app"]` are not included in `tools/list` when `$clientSupportsUI` is false. This prevents non-UI clients from seeing tools they cannot use.
- **Tool results are mostly unchanged.** The existing tool evaluation pipeline continues to return text + base64 PNG content items. The one exception is WolframAlpha (see Phase 2): when `$clientSupportsUI` is true, a JSON metadata content item is prepended with the cloud notebook URL. The text + image items are always included regardless, so the LLM always receives usable text.
- **`resources/read` for unknown URIs** returns a standard MCP error:

```json
{
    "jsonrpc": "2.0",
    "id": 2,
    "error": { "code": -32602, "message": "UI resource not found: ui://wolfram/unknown" }
}
```

#### 1.6 EnableMCPApps Option

Users can disable MCP Apps at install time via an `"EnableMCPApps"` option on `InstallMCPServer`. When disabled, the server behaves as if the client does not support MCP Apps, regardless of what the client actually advertises.

**Option definition:**

| Option | Default | Description |
|--------|---------|-------------|
| `"EnableMCPApps"` | `True` | Whether to enable MCP Apps UI features for this installation |

**Environment variable:**

The option is communicated to the server process via the `MCP_APPS_ENABLED` environment variable in the MCP config's `"env"` block:

| `"EnableMCPApps"` value | Environment variable | Server behavior |
|-------------------------|---------------------|-----------------|
| `True` (default) | Not set (absent) | MCP Apps enabled if client supports it |
| `False` | `"MCP_APPS_ENABLED": "false"` | MCP Apps disabled regardless of client |

When `"EnableMCPApps"` is `True` (the default), no environment variable is injected. The absence of the variable means MCP Apps are enabled, preserving backward compatibility with existing installations.

**Runtime behavior:**

During the `initialize` handler in `StartMCPServer.wl`, after checking client capabilities with `clientSupportsUIQ`, the server also checks `Environment["MCP_APPS_ENABLED"]`. If the value is `"false"` (case-insensitive), `$clientSupportsUI` is forced to `False`.

```
$clientSupportsUI = mcpAppsEnabled[] && clientSupportsUIQ[msg]
```

Where `mcpAppsEnabled[]` returns `False` when `Environment["MCP_APPS_ENABLED"]` is `"false"` (case-insensitive), and `True` otherwise (including when the variable is not set).

**Effect cascade when disabled:**

Setting `"EnableMCPApps" -> False` triggers the same non-UI code path as a client that does not advertise MCP Apps support:

- `$clientSupportsUI` is `False`
- `initialize` response omits `capabilities.extensions`
- `tools/list` omits `_meta.ui` on all tools and excludes app-only tools
- `resources/list` returns empty `{ "resources": [] }`
- Tool results use standard text + base64 PNG format only (no CloudDeploy, no `notebookUrl` metadata)

#### 1.7 Directory Structure

```
Assets/
    Apps/
        wolframalpha-viewer.html     -- WolframAlpha interactive viewer
        wolframalpha-viewer.json     -- CSP and metadata for WA viewer
        evaluator-viewer.html        -- WL Evaluator interactive viewer
        evaluator-viewer.json        -- CSP and metadata for evaluator viewer

    Messages.wl                      -- Modified: new error messages
```

#### 1.8 Error Messages

New error message tags:

| Tag | Description |
|-----|-------------|
| `UIResourceNotFound` | Requested `ui://` URI does not exist in the registry |
| `UIResourceLoadFailed` | Failed to load an HTML asset file |
| `UIAppAssetsMissing` | The `Assets/Apps` directory was not found |

#### 1.9 PacletInfo.wl Changes

Register the `Apps` asset location so it can be resolved via `PacletObject["Wolfram/AgentTools"]["AssetLocation", "Apps"]`.

---

### Phase 2: WolframAlpha Interactive Viewer

An HTML app that displays WolframAlpha results as an interactive cloud notebook, using the same WolframNotebookEmbedder approach as the NotebookViewer tool.

**Background:** WolframAlpha does not allow iframe embedding (`X-Frame-Options: SAMEORIGIN`), so embedding `wolframalpha.com` directly is not viable. Instead, the server formats WA results into a Wolfram Notebook, CloudDeploys it, and the app embeds the cloud notebook using WolframNotebookEmbedder.

#### 2.1 Design Goals

- Format WolframAlpha results as an interactive Wolfram Cloud notebook using Chatbook's `FormatWolframAlphaPods`
- CloudDeploy the formatted notebook and embed it via WolframNotebookEmbedder (same approach as NotebookViewer)
- Maintain the text + base64 PNG tool result for the LLM's consumption (unchanged)
- Include a JSON metadata content item with the cloud notebook URL so the app can extract and embed it
- Allow the user to submit follow-up queries from within the app (each follow-up deploys a new notebook)
- Use host CSS variables for theming the query bar chrome
- Graceful fallback: when UI is not supported or CloudDeploy fails, the tool keeps current behavior (text + base64 PNG only)

#### 2.2 Data Flow

```
LLM calls WolframAlpha tool with { "query": "current distance to Mars" }
    -> Host sends ui/notifications/tool-input to the WA viewer app
       (App shows query in query bar, displays loading state)
    -> Server's UI-aware evaluation pipeline runs:
       1. Calls Chatbook with $ChatNotebookEvaluation = True
          -> Returns structured result with pods data and text string
       2. Extracts images from the text string for the LLM (unchanged pipeline)
       3. Formats pods via FormatWolframAlphaPods (with FoldPods = True)
       4. Creates a Notebook with input cell (query) and output cell (formatted pods)
       5. CloudDeploys to AgentTools/Notebooks/WolframAlpha/<encoded-query>.nb
          with Permissions -> {"All" -> {"Read", "Interact"}}, AutoRemove -> True
       6. Returns content items:
          - JSON metadata item: {"notebookUrl": "https://www.wolframcloud.com/obj/..."}
          - Text items + base64 PNG images (for the LLM, unchanged)
    -> Host receives tool result, sends ui/notifications/tool-result to app
    -> App parses content items, finds the JSON metadata item with "notebookUrl"
    -> App loads WolframNotebookEmbedder and embeds the cloud notebook
    -> User sees interactive formatted WA results (pods, collapsible details, etc.)
```

**Key difference from NotebookViewer:** The NotebookViewer tool receives the URL as a tool *input argument*, so the app can start embedding immediately on `tool-input`. The WolframAlpha tool *generates* the URL during execution, so the app must wait for `tool-result` to get the notebook URL.

**Follow-up queries:**

```
User edits query bar and clicks "Go"
    -> App calls tools/call "WolframAlpha" with { "query": "<new query>" }
    -> Server runs the same pipeline: Chatbook -> FormatWolframAlphaPods -> CloudDeploy
    -> App receives tools/call response with new notebookUrl
    -> App detaches previous embedded notebook, embeds the new one
```

#### 2.3 HTML App: `wolframalpha-viewer.html`

**High-level features:**

- **Notebook embed**: Uses WolframNotebookEmbedder (loaded from unpkg CDN) to render the cloud notebook -- identical library and technique as `notebook-viewer.html`
- **Query bar**: Shows the current query above the notebook embed; editable for follow-up queries
- **Loading state**: Spinner shown while the server processes the query and deploys the notebook
- **Responsive**: Fills container; auto-resize via `ui/notifications/size-changed`
- **Theming**: Uses CSS variables from host context for the query bar and chrome
- **"Open in W|A" link**: External link to `wolframalpha.com` for the current query

**Key UI components:**

- Query bar with input field, "Go" button, and "Open in W|A" link
- Notebook embed container (replaces text/image rendering with WolframNotebookEmbedder)
- Loading indicator
- Error display

**Lifecycle handling:**

```
ui/initialize
    -> Store host context, theme
    -> Load WolframNotebookEmbedder library from CDN
    -> Display empty state

ui/notifications/tool-input
    -> Extract query from tool input arguments
    -> Display query in query bar, update "Open in W|A" link
    -> Show loading indicator
    -> (Do NOT embed anything yet -- notebook URL is not known until tool-result)

ui/notifications/tool-result
    -> Parse content items
    -> Find the metadata content item containing {"notebookUrl": "https://..."}
    -> If found: embed the notebook using WolframNotebookEmbedder.embed(url, container, opts)
    -> If not found (fallback): render text/image content items directly
    -> Hide loading indicator

User edits query and clicks "Go"
    -> Call tools/call "WolframAlpha" with { "query": "<new query>" }
    -> Detach previous embedded notebook
    -> Show loading indicator
    -> On tools/call response: parse content, find notebookUrl, embed new notebook

ui/notifications/tool-cancelled
    -> Hide loading indicator

ui/resource-teardown
    -> Detach embedded notebook if any
```

**Metadata content item detection:**

The app identifies the metadata item by attempting to parse each text content item as JSON and checking for the `notebookUrl` key. If no `notebookUrl` is found (e.g., CloudDeploy failed and the tool fell back to standard output), the app renders text and base64 images directly. This ensures the app works gracefully even when the server-side notebook formatting fails.

#### 2.4 CSP Metadata: `wolframalpha-viewer.json`

```json
{
    "ui": {
        "csp": {
            "connectDomains": [
                "https://www.wolframcloud.com"
            ],
            "resourceDomains": [
                "https://unpkg.com",
                "https://www.wolframcloud.com"
            ],
            "frameDomains": [
                "https://www.wolframcloud.com",
                "https://wolfr.am"
            ]
        },
        "prefersBorder": true
    }
}
```

This is identical to `notebook-viewer.json` because the WolframAlpha viewer uses the same WolframNotebookEmbedder approach:

- `connectDomains`: WolframNotebookEmbedder needs XHR/WebSocket access to wolframcloud.com
- `resourceDomains`: The embedder JS library loads from unpkg.com; notebook resources load from wolframcloud.com
- `frameDomains`: The embedded notebook renders in an iframe pointing to wolframcloud.com

#### 2.5 WolframAlpha Tool Changes

When the client supports UI, the WolframAlpha tool runs an enhanced pipeline that produces a cloud notebook alongside the standard text + image output.

**Server-side pipeline (UI-capable client):**

1. Call Chatbook's WolframAlpha handler with `$ChatNotebookEvaluation = True` to get structured result data (pods + text string).
2. Extract images from the text string for the LLM (unchanged from current behavior).
3. Format the pods data into notebook cells using `FormatWolframAlphaPods` with `FoldPods = True`.
4. Wrap in a `Notebook` with a `"WolframAlphaLong"` input cell and an `"Output"` cell.
5. CloudDeploy the notebook to `AgentTools/Notebooks/WolframAlpha/<encoded-query>.nb` with `Permissions -> {"All" -> {"Read", "Interact"}}`, `AutoRemove -> True`, and `IconRules -> {}`.
6. Return content items: a JSON metadata item (`{"notebookUrl": "<url>"}`) followed by the standard text + image items.

**Key design decisions:**

- **Fallback on failure**: If any step fails (CloudDeploy error, missing cloud credentials, network issue), fall back to the standard text + image behavior. The app's fallback rendering handles this gracefully.
- **Content item ordering**: The metadata item comes first so the app can find it quickly.
- **AutoRemove -> True**: Cloud notebooks auto-expire, avoiding cleanup burden.
- **IconRules -> {}**: Skips icon generation for the temporary cloud file.

### Phase 3: WL Evaluator Interactive Viewer

An HTML app that renders Wolfram Language evaluator results with support for interactive graphics, cloud-deployed content, and rich formatted output.

#### 3.1 Design Goals

- Display evaluation results with syntax-highlighted code and formatted output
- Embed CloudDeploy results in iframes (for `Manipulate`, interactive plots, etc.)
- Render base64 PNG images with zoom
- Show `Print` output and messages in a console-style area
- Support re-evaluation with modified code
- Display markdown-formatted text results

#### 3.2 Data Flow

```
LLM calls WolframLanguageEvaluator tool
    -> Server evaluates code, returns structured content:
        - Text items: evaluation result as string, print output
        - Image items: base64 PNG for graphics
        - Text items with cloud URLs: "![Image](https://...)" markdown links
    -> Host receives tool result
    -> Host sends ui/notifications/tool-result to the evaluator viewer app
    -> App parses content items:
        - Detect cloud URLs (CloudObject patterns) -> render in iframe
        - Detect base64 images -> render with zoom
        - Detect text -> render with formatting
    -> User interacts (zoom images, interact with cloud content, re-evaluate)
```

#### 3.3 HTML App: `evaluator-viewer.html`

**High-level features:**

- **Code display**: Show the evaluated code with syntax highlighting (WL keywords)
- **Result area**: Formatted output with support for multiple content types
- **Cloud iframe**: When a cloud URL is detected in the result, embed it in an iframe for live interaction (e.g., `Manipulate`, `DynamicModule`)
- **Image viewer**: Zoomable PNG display for static graphics
- **Console output**: Collapsible section showing `Print` statements and messages
- **Re-evaluate**: Button/input to modify and re-run code via `tools/call`
- **Theming**: Uses host CSS variables

**Key UI components:**

- Code block with WL syntax highlighting
- Output panel (auto-switches between text, image, iframe based on content type)
- Cloud content iframe container with loading indicator
- Print/message console (collapsed by default)
- Re-evaluate input area with code editor
- Fullscreen toggle button

**Content type detection logic:**

```
For each content item in tool result:
    if type == "image":
        -> Render as zoomable <img> with base64 src
    if type == "text" and contains "![Image](https://www.wolframcloud.com/...)"
        -> Extract URL, render in <iframe> with sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin"
    if type == "text" and contains "![Image](local://...)"
        -> Render as linked image (if accessible) or show URL
    if type == "text":
        -> Render as formatted text/code block
```

#### 3.4 CSP Metadata: `evaluator-viewer.json`

```json
{
    "ui": {
        "csp": {
            "connectDomains": [],
            "resourceDomains": [],
            "frameDomains": [
                "https://www.wolframcloud.com",
                "https://wolfr.am"
            ]
        },
        "prefersBorder": true
    }
}
```

The `frameDomains` entry allows embedding Wolfram Cloud deployed content in iframes within the app.

---

### Phase 4: App-Only Tools (Optional)

Hidden tools (visibility `["app"]`) that are callable only by the UI apps, not visible to the LLM. These support app-side interactivity without polluting the LLM's tool list.

**This phase is optional.** The WolframAlpha viewer (Phase 2) does not need app-only tools since follow-up queries are handled by calling the existing `WolframAlpha` tool via `tools/call` (visibility `["model", "app"]`). The evaluator viewer (Phase 3) can call the existing `WolframLanguageEvaluator` tool directly. App-only tools should only be implemented if:

- We want to separate app-initiated calls from LLM-initiated calls for logging/analytics
- We discover during Phase 3 implementation that the standard tool is awkward for app use

**Go/no-go criteria:** Implement Phase 4 only after Phase 2 and Phase 3 are complete and tested.

#### 4.1 Re-Evaluate Tool

**Purpose:** Allow the evaluator viewer app to re-evaluate modified code without the LLM seeing or calling this tool.

**Tool definition:**

```json
{
    "name": "WolframLanguageReEvaluate",
    "description": "Re-evaluate modified Wolfram Language code from the interactive viewer.",
    "inputSchema": {
        "type": "object",
        "properties": {
            "code": { "type": "string", "description": "The modified Wolfram Language code to evaluate" },
            "timeConstraint": { "type": "integer", "description": "Time constraint in seconds (default: 60)" }
        },
        "required": ["code"]
    },
    "_meta": {
        "ui": {
            "visibility": ["app"]
        }
    }
}
```

Delegates to the same evaluation function as `WolframLanguageEvaluator`.

#### 4.2 Registration

App-only tools are registered conditionally: only when `$clientSupportsUI` is true. They must include `_meta.ui.visibility` set to `["app"]` so the host knows not to show them to the LLM.

## Protocol Messages Reference

### Initialize (with MCP Apps)

**Client request:**
```json
{
    "jsonrpc": "2.0",
    "id": 0,
    "method": "initialize",
    "params": {
        "protocolVersion": "2024-11-05",

                }
            }
        }
    ]
}
```

### Tools Call

Tool call and result format is unchanged for most tools. The host forwards the result to the UI app via `ui/notifications/tool-result` using the standard content items format that the server already produces.

**Exception: WolframAlpha tool result (UI-capable client):**

When the client supports UI, the WolframAlpha tool prepends a JSON metadata content item with the cloud notebook URL:

```json
{
    "jsonrpc": "2.0",
    "id": 5,
    "result": {
        "content": [
            {
                "type": "text",
                "text": "{\"notebookUrl\":\"https://www.wolframcloud.com/obj/user/AgentTools/Notebooks/WolframAlpha/current+distance+to+Mars.nb\"}"
            },
            {
                "type": "text",
                "text": "Input: current distance to Mars\n\nResult: 1.234 AU (astronomical units)..."
            },
            {
                "type": "image",
                "mimeType": "image/png",
                "data": "iVBOR..."
            }
        ],
        "isError": false
    }
}
```

**WolframAlpha tool result (non-UI client, unchanged):**

```json
{
    "jsonrpc": "2.0",
    "id": 5,
    "result": {
        "content": [
            {
                "type": "text",
                "text": "Input: current distance to Mars\n\nResult: 1.234 AU (astronomical units)..."
            },
            {
                "type": "image",
                "mimeType": "image/png",
                "data": "iVBOR..."
            }
        ],
        "isError": false
    }
}
```

## Security Considerations

### Content Security Policy

CSP metadata flows as follows:

1. **Server** declares CSP requirements in `_meta.ui.csp` within the `resources/read` response
2. **Host** reads the CSP metadata and constructs HTTP `Content-Security-Policy` headers (or equivalent) for the iframe
3. **Host** applies a restrictive default CSP if the server omits the `csp` field

The server does **not** generate CSP headers or embed them in the HTML. The server only declares *what external access the app requires*; the host enforces it.

**Per-app CSP:**

- **WolframAlpha viewer**: Requires `connectDomains` for `https://www.wolframcloud.com` (WolframNotebookEmbedder API communication), `resourceDomains` for `https://unpkg.com` (embedder JS library) and `https://www.wolframcloud.com` (notebook resources), and `frameDomains` for `https://www.wolframcloud.com` and `https://wolfr.am` (embedded notebook iframe). This is identical to the NotebookViewer CSP because both apps use the same WolframNotebookEmbedder approach.
- **Evaluator viewer**: Requires `frameDomains` for `https://www.wolframcloud.com` and `https://wolfr.am` to embed CloudDeploy results. No `connectDomains` needed since the app does not make direct API calls.

### Iframe Sandbox

All apps run in sandboxed iframes controlled by the host. The server does not control iframe sandbox attributes; it only declares CSP and permission requirements via `_meta.ui` in the `resources/read` response. The host applies sandbox attributes (typically `sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin"`) and sets CSP headers based on the server's declared metadata.

### Tool Visibility

App-only tools (visibility `["app"]`) prevent the LLM from accidentally calling internal tools. Visibility enforcement is a **host responsibility**: the host filters the tool list before presenting it to the LLM. The server includes visibility metadata in the `_meta.ui.visibility` field for the host to use.

Additionally, the server excludes app-only tools from `tools/list` when the client does not support UI, as a defense-in-depth measure.

### Input Validation

- `resources/read` URIs are validated against the registry; unknown URIs return an error
- HTML apps are static assets bundled with the paclet, not dynamically generated from user input
- No user-controlled content is interpolated into HTML templates at the server level
- HTML asset files are treated as trusted (they ship with the paclet); there is no runtime sanitization of asset content
- Tool results forwarded to apps (via `ui/notifications/tool-result`) contain the same content items the server already produces; apps are responsible for safely rendering this data

## Testing Plan

### Unit Tests

Test file: `Tests/MCPApps.wlt`

#### Extension Negotiation

1. **UI client negotiation** -- init response includes `extensions` when client advertises UI support
2. **Non-UI client** -- init response omits `extensions` when client does not advertise UI
3. **UI detection** -- correctly parses various client capability formats

#### EnableMCPApps Option

4. **MCP Apps disabled via env var** -- `$clientSupportsUI` is `False` when `MCP_APPS_ENABLED` is `"false"`, even if client advertises UI support
5. **MCP Apps enabled by default** -- `$clientSupportsUI` follows client capabilities when `MCP_APPS_ENABLED` is not set
6. **Case insensitivity** -- `MCP_APPS_ENABLED` check is case-insensitive (`"False"`, `"FALSE"`, `"false"` all disable)

#### Resource Registry

7. **Load resource** -- loads HTML file and optional JSON metadata
8. **Initialize resources** -- populates registry from assets directory
9. **Missing assets** -- graceful fallback when assets directory is missing

#### Resource Handlers

10. **resources/list** -- returns UI resources for UI-capable clients, empty for others
11. **resources/read** -- returns HTML content and metadata for valid URI
12. **resources/read unknown URI** -- returns error for unknown URI

#### Tool Metadata

13. **UI metadata attached** -- `_meta.ui` attached for tools with UI associations
14. **No UI metadata** -- no `_meta` for tools without UI associations
15. **tools/list with UI** -- includes `_meta` in tool definitions for UI clients
16. **tools/list without UI** -- omits `_meta` for non-UI clients

#### App-Only Tools

17. **App-only tool registration** -- app-only tools registered when UI supported
18. **App-only tool visibility** -- visibility is `["app"]` in tool list
19. **App-only tools absent** -- not registered when UI not supported

#### WolframAlpha Tool (UI-Aware Behavior)

20. **WolframAlpha with UI** -- returns content items including a JSON metadata item with `notebookUrl` key
21. **WolframAlpha without UI** -- returns text + base64 PNG only (backward compatibility)
22. **WolframAlpha fallback** -- falls back to text + base64 PNG when CloudDeploy fails
23. **Metadata item format** -- the JSON metadata item parses correctly and contains a valid wolframcloud.com URL

### Integration Tests

24. **Full initialize handshake** -- send initialize with UI extension, verify response
25. **Full resource fetch** -- initialize -> resources/list -> resources/read
26. **Tool call with UI metadata** -- initialize -> tools/list, verify _meta present
27. **Backward compatibility** -- initialize without extensions, verify identical behavior to current

    └── 1.7-1.9 Directory structure, messages, PacletInfo

Phase 2 (WolframAlpha App)
    └── Depends on Phase 1 complete
    └── Can be developed/tested independently once Phase 1 is in place

Phase 3 (Evaluator App)
    └── Depends on Phase 1 complete
    └── Can be developed in parallel with Phase 2

Phase 4 (App-Only Tools) [Optional]
    └── Depends on Phase 1 (tool registration) + Phase 3 (evaluator app)
    └── Go/no-go decision after Phase 3 is implemented and tested
```

## Future Considerations

1. **Dynamic UI resources** -- Generate HTML apps dynamically based on tool results (e.g., specialized viewers for different WA result types)
2. **Notebook rendering** -- An MCP App that renders Wolfram notebooks in the conversation
3. **Manipulate support** -- Direct support for `Manipulate` expressions via CloudDeploy + iframe
4. **Streaming results** -- Use `ui/notifications/tool-input-partial` for streaming partial WL evaluation results
5. **Context updates** -- Use `ui/update-model-context` to feed interactive exploration results back to the LLM
6. **Additional viewers** -- Specialized apps for 3D graphics (`Graphics3D`), datasets (`Dataset`), entity stores, etc.
7. **Theme sync** -- Read host theme CSS variables and apply Wolfram-style formatting that matches the host's appearance
8. **Hot-reload for development** -- Reload HTML app assets without restarting the server (e.g., watch `Assets/Apps/` for changes)
9. **Asset versioning** -- Cache-busting mechanism so hosts re-fetch updated apps when the paclet version changes
